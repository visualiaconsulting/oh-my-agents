To use in another project, copy `.opencode/agents/` to the target project
and modify this `CONTEXT.md` with the description of the actual project.

## Session Continuity (v1.6.0)

This project supports automatic session continuity. With auto-session enabled, each OpenCode session is automatically saved to `.opencode/project.db` (SQLite database) and `.opencode/sessions/` (JSON backup).

Commands:
- `python main.py --auto-enable` — Enable automatic session saving
- `python main.py --project-status` — View project continuity status
- `python main.py --continue` — Show re-entry context from last session
- `python main.py --project-health` — Check project health
- `python main.py --list-tasks` — List pending tasks
- `python main.py --sessions` — View full session history
- `python main.py --auto-disable` — Disable auto-session

The system is being used successfully in production in the RoadFlow project.

## Skills

Skills from skills.sh can be installed to extend agent capabilities:
- `python main.py --skills-search <query>` to search skills.sh
- `python main.py --skills-install owner/repo/name` to install a skill
- `python main.py --skills` to list installed skills

Installed skills are stored in `.opencode/skills/` and injected into context.

## MCP Support

This project supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.
Configure servers in `.opencode/mcp.json`.

## Recent Session History

### Session 1 — 2026-04-30 11:51:55 (agent: @code-analyst)

**Summary:** Refactored session scanning logic

# Neon Serverless Postgres

Neon is a serverless Postgres platform that separates compute and storage to offer autoscaling, branching, instant restore, and scale-to-zero. It's fully compatible with Postgres and works with any language, framework, or ORM that supports Postgres.

## Neon Documentation

The Neon documentation is the source of truth for all Neon-related information. Always verify claims against the official docs before responding. Neon features and APIs evolve, so prefer fetching current docs over relying on training data.

### Fetching Docs as Markdown

Any Neon doc page can be fetched as markdown in two ways:

1. **Append `.md` to the URL** (simplest): https://neon.com/docs/introduction/branching.md
2. **Request `text/markdown`** on the standard URL: `curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://neon.com/docs/introduction/branching`

Both return the same markdown content. Use whichever method your tools support.

### Finding the Right Page

The docs index lists every available page with its URL and a short description:

```
https://neon.com/docs/llms.txt
```

Common doc URLs are organized in the topic links below. If you need a page not listed here, search the docs index: https://neon.com/docs/llms.txt — don't guess URLs.

## What Is Neon

Use this for architecture explanations and terminology (organizations, projects, branches, endpoints) before giving implementation advice.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/what-is-neon.md

## Getting Started

Use this for first-time setup: org/project selection, connection strings, driver installation, optional auth, and initial schema setup.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/getting-started.md

## Connection Methods & Drivers

Use this when you need to pick the correct transport and driver based on runtime constraints (TCP, HTTP, WebSocket, edge, serverless, long-running).

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/connection-methods.md

### Serverless Driver

Use this for `@neondatabase/serverless` patterns, including HTTP queries, WebSocket transactions, and runtime-specific optimizations.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/neon-serverless.md

### Neon JS SDK

Use this for combined Neon Auth + Data API workflows with PostgREST-style querying and typed client setup.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/neon-js.md

## Developer Tools

Use this for local development enablement with `npx neonctl@latest init`, VSCode extension setup, and Neon MCP server configuration.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/devtools.md

### Neon CLI

Use this for terminal-first workflows, scripts, and CI/CD automation with `neonctl`.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/neon-cli.md

## Neon Admin API

The Neon Admin API can be used to manage Neon resources programmatically. It is used behind the scenes by the Neon CLI and MCP server, but can also be used directly for more complex automation workflows or when embedding Neon in other applications.

### Neon REST API

Use this for direct HTTP automation, endpoint-level control, API key auth, rate-limit handling, and operation polling.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/neon-rest-api.md

### Neon TypeScript SDK

Use this when implementing typed programmatic control of Neon resources in TypeScript via `@neondatabase/api-client`.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/neon-typescript-sdk.md

### Neon Python SDK

Use this when implementing programmatic Neon management in Python with the `neon-api` package.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/neon-python-sdk.md

## Neon Auth

Use this for managed user authentication setup, UI components, auth methods, and Neon Auth integration pitfalls in Next.js and React apps.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/neon-auth.md

Neon Auth is also embedded in the Neon JS SDK - so depending on your use case, you may want to use the Neon JS SDK instead of Neon Auth. See https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/connection-methods.md for more details.

## Branching

Use this when the user is planning isolated environments, schema migration testing, preview deployments, or branch lifecycle automation.

Key points:

- Branches are instant, copy-on-write clones (no full data copy).
- Each branch has its own compute endpoint.
- Use the neonctl CLI or MCP server to create, inspect, and compare branches.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/ai/skills/neon-postgres/references/branching.md

## Autoscaling

Use this when the user needs compute to scale automatically with workload and wants guidance on CU sizing and runtime behavior.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/introduction/autoscaling.md

## Scale to Zero

Use this when optimizing idle costs and discussing suspend/resume behavior, including cold-start trade-offs.

Key points:

- Idle computes suspend automatically (default 5 minutes, configurable) (unless disabled - launch & scale plan only)
- First query after suspend typically has a cold-start penalty (around hundreds of ms)
- Storage remains active while compute is suspended.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/introduction/scale-to-zero.md

## Instant Restore

Use this when the user needs point-in-time recovery or wants to restore data state without traditional backup restore workflows.

Key points:

- Restore windows depend on plan limits.
- Users can create branches from historical points-in-time.
- Time Travel queries can be used for historical inspection workflows.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/introduction/branch-restore.md

## Read Replicas

Use this for read-heavy workloads where the user needs dedicated read-only compute without duplicating storage.

Key points:

- Replicas are read-only compute endpoints sharing the same storage.
- Creation is fast and scaling is independent from primary compute.
- Typical use cases: analytics, reporting, and read-heavy APIs.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/introduction/read-replicas.md

## Connection Pooling

Use this when the user is in serverless or high-concurrency environments and needs safe, scalable Postgres connection management.

Key points:

- Neon pooling uses PgBouncer.
- Add `-pooler` to endpoint hostnames to use pooled connections.
- Pooling is especially important in serverless runtimes with bursty concurrency.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/connect/connection-pooling.md

## IP Allow Lists

Use this when the user needs to restrict database access by trusted networks, IPs, or CIDR ranges.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/introduction/ip-allow.md

## Logical Replication

Use this when integrating CDC pipelines, external Postgres sync, or replication-based data movement.

Key points:

- Neon supports native logical replication workflows.
- Useful for replicating to/from external Postgres systems.

Link: https://neon.com/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide.md

# Python Testing Patterns

Comprehensive guide to implementing robust testing strategies in Python using pytest, fixtures, mocking, parameterization, and test-driven development practices.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing unit tests for Python code
- Setting up test suites and test infrastructure
- Implementing test-driven development (TDD)
- Creating integration tests for APIs and services
- Mocking external dependencies and services
- Testing async code and concurrent operations
- Setting up continuous testing in CI/CD
- Implementing property-based testing
- Testing database operations
- Debugging failing tests

## Core Concepts

### 1. Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
- **Functional Tests**: Test complete features end-to-end
- **Performance Tests**: Measure speed and resource usage

### 2. Test Structure (AAA Pattern)

- **Arrange**: Set up test data and preconditions
- **Act**: Execute the code under test
- **Assert**: Verify the results

### 3. Test Coverage

- Measure what code is exercised by tests
- Identify untested code paths
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not just high percentages

### 4. Test Isolation

- Tests should be independent
- No shared state between tests
- Each test should clean up after itself

## Quick Start

```python
# test_example.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    """Basic test example."""
    result = add(2, 3)
    assert result == 5

def test_add_negative():
    """Test with negative numbers."""
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0

# Run with: pytest test_example.py
```

## Fundamental Patterns

### Pattern 1: Basic pytest Tests

```python
# test_calculator.py
import pytest

class Calculator:
    """Simple calculator for testing."""

    def add(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
        return a - b

    def multiply(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
        return a * b

    def divide(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return a / b


def test_addition():
    """Test addition."""
    calc = Calculator()
    assert calc.add(2, 3) == 5
    assert calc.add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert calc.add(0, 0) == 0


def test_subtraction():
    """Test subtraction."""
    calc = Calculator()
    assert calc.subtract(5, 3) == 2
    assert calc.subtract(0, 5) == -5


def test_multiplication():
    """Test multiplication."""
    calc = Calculator()
    assert calc.multiply(3, 4) == 12
    assert calc.multiply(0, 5) == 0


def test_division():
    """Test division."""
    calc = Calculator()
    assert calc.divide(6, 3) == 2
    assert calc.divide(5, 2) == 2.5


def test_division_by_zero():
    """Test division by zero raises error."""
    calc = Calculator()
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Cannot divide by zero"):
        calc.divide(5, 0)
```

### Pattern 2: Fixtures for Setup and Teardown

```python
# test_database.py
import pytest
from typing import Generator

class Database:
    """Simple database class."""

    def __init__(self, connection_string: str):
        self.connection_string = connection_string
        self.connected = False

    def connect(self):
        """Connect to database."""
        self.connected = True

    def disconnect(self):
        """Disconnect from database."""
        self.connected = False

    def query(self, sql: str) -> list:
        """Execute query."""
        if not self.connected:
            raise RuntimeError("Not connected")
        return [{"id": 1, "name": "Test"}]


@pytest.fixture
def db() -> Generator[Database, None, None]:
    """Fixture that provides connected database."""
    # Setup
    database = Database("sqlite:///:memory:")
    database.connect()

    # Provide to test
    yield database

    # Teardown
    database.disconnect()


def test_database_query(db):
    """Test database query with fixture."""
    results = db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
    assert len(results) == 1
    assert results[0]["name"] == "Test"


@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def app_config():
    """Session-scoped fixture - created once per test session."""
    return {
        "database_url": "postgresql://localhost/test",
        "api_key": "test-key",
        "debug": True
    }


@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def api_client(app_config):
    """Module-scoped fixture - created once per test module."""
    # Setup expensive resource
    client = {"config": app_config, "session": "active"}
    yield client
    # Cleanup
    client["session"] = "closed"


def test_api_client(api_client):
    """Test using api client fixture."""
    assert api_client["session"] == "active"
    assert api_client["config"]["debug"] is True
```

### Pattern 3: Parameterized Tests

```python
# test_validation.py
import pytest

def is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:
    """Check if email is valid."""
    return "@" in email and "." in email.split("@")[1]


@pytest.mark.parametrize("email,expected", [
    ("user@example.com", True),
    ("test.user@domain.co.uk", True),
    ("invalid.email", False),
    ("@example.com", False),
    ("user@domain", False),
    ("", False),
])
def test_email_validation(email, expected):
    """Test email validation with various inputs."""
    assert is_valid_email(email) == expected


@pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", [
    (2, 3, 5),
    (0, 0, 0),
    (-1, 1, 0),
    (100, 200, 300),
    (-5, -5, -10),
])
def test_addition_parameterized(a, b, expected):
    """Test addition with multiple parameter sets."""
    from test_calculator import Calculator
    calc = Calculator()
    assert calc.add(a, b) == expected


# Using pytest.param for special cases
@pytest.mark.parametrize("value,expected", [
    pytest.param(1, True, id="positive"),
    pytest.param(0, False, id="zero"),
    pytest.param(-1, False, id="negative"),
])
def test_is_positive(value, expected):
    """Test with custom test IDs."""
    assert (value > 0) == expected
```

### Pattern 4: Mocking with unittest.mock

```python
# test_api_client.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch, MagicMock
import requests

class APIClient:
    """Simple API client."""

    def __init__(self, base_url: str):
        self.base_url = base_url

    def get_user(self, user_id: int) -> dict:
        """Fetch user from API."""
        response = requests.get(f"{self.base_url}/users/{user_id}")
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()

    def create_user(self, data: dict) -> dict:
        """Create new user."""
        response = requests.post(f"{self.base_url}/users", json=data)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()


def test_get_user_success():
    """Test successful API call with mock."""
    client = APIClient("https://api.example.com")

    mock_response = Mock()
    mock_response.json.return_value = {"id": 1, "name": "John Doe"}
    mock_response.raise_for_status.return_value = None

    with patch("requests.get", return_value=mock_response) as mock_get:
        user = client.get_user(1)

        assert user["id"] == 1
        assert user["name"] == "John Doe"
        mock_get.assert_called_once_with("https://api.example.com/users/1")


def test_get_user_not_found():
    """Test API call with 404 error."""
    client = APIClient("https://api.example.com")

    mock_response = Mock()
    mock_response.raise_for_status.side_effect = requests.HTTPError("404 Not Found")

    with patch("requests.get", return_value=mock_response):
        with pytest.raises(requests.HTTPError):
            client.get_user(999)


@patch("requests.post")
def test_create_user(mock_post):
    """Test user creation with decorator syntax."""
    client = APIClient("https://api.example.com")

    mock_post.return_value.json.return_value = {"id": 2, "name": "Jane Doe"}
    mock_post.return_value.raise_for_status.return_value = None

    user_data = {"name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com"}
    result = client.create_user(user_data)

    assert result["id"] == 2
    mock_post.assert_called_once()
    call_args = mock_post.call_args
    assert call_args.kwargs["json"] == user_data
```

### Pattern 5: Testing Exceptions

```python
# test_exceptions.py
import pytest

def divide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Divide a by b."""
    if b == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Division by zero")
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Arguments must be numbers")
    return a / b


def test_zero_division():
    """Test exception is raised for division by zero."""
    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        divide(10, 0)


def test_zero_division_with_message():
    """Test exception message."""
    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError, match="Division by zero"):
        divide(5, 0)


def test_type_error():
    """Test type error exception."""
    with pytest.raises(TypeError, match="must be numbers"):
        divide("10", 5)


def test_exception_info():
    """Test accessing exception info."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        int("not a number")

    assert "invalid literal" in str(exc_info.value)
```

For advanced patterns including async testing, monkeypatching, temporary files, conftest setup, property-based testing, database testing, CI/CD integration, and configuration files, see [references/advanced-patterns.md](references/advanced-patterns.md)

## Test Design Principles

### One Behavior Per Test

Each test should verify exactly one behavior. This makes failures easy to diagnose and tests easy to maintain.

```python
# BAD - testing multiple behaviors
def test_user_service():
    user = service.create_user(data)
    assert user.id is not None
    assert user.email == data["email"]
    updated = service.update_user(user.id, {"name": "New"})
    assert updated.name == "New"

# GOOD - focused tests
def test_create_user_assigns_id():
    user = service.create_user(data)
    assert user.id is not None

def test_create_user_stores_email():
    user = service.create_user(data)
    assert user.email == data["email"]

def test_update_user_changes_name():
    user = service.create_user(data)
    updated = service.update_user(user.id, {"name": "New"})
    assert updated.name == "New"
```

### Test Error Paths

Always test failure cases, not just happy paths.

```python
def test_get_user_raises_not_found():
    with pytest.raises(UserNotFoundError) as exc_info:
        service.get_user("nonexistent-id")

    assert "nonexistent-id" in str(exc_info.value)

def test_create_user_rejects_invalid_email():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid email format"):
        service.create_user({"email": "not-an-email"})
```

## Testing Best Practices

### Test Organization

```python
# tests/
#   __init__.py
#   conftest.py           # Shared fixtures
#   test_unit/            # Unit tests
#     test_models.py
#     test_utils.py
#   test_integration/     # Integration tests
#     test_api.py
#     test_database.py
#   test_e2e/            # End-to-end tests
#     test_workflows.py
```

### Test Naming Convention

A common pattern: `test_<unit>_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>`. Adapt to your team's preferences.

```python
# Pattern: test_<unit>_<scenario>_<expected>
def test_create_user_with_valid_data_returns_user():
    ...

def test_create_user_with_duplicate_email_raises_conflict():
    ...

def test_get_user_with_unknown_id_returns_none():
    ...

# Good test names - clear and descriptive
def test_user_creation_with_valid_data():
    """Clear name describes what is being tested."""
    pass

def test_login_fails_with_invalid_password():
    """Name describes expected behavior."""
    pass

def test_api_returns_404_for_missing_resource():
    """Specific about inputs and expected outcomes."""
    pass

# Bad test names - avoid these
def test_1():  # Not descriptive
    pass

def test_user():  # Too vague
    pass

def test_function():  # Doesn't explain what's tested
    pass
```

### Testing Retry Behavior

Verify that retry logic works correctly using mock side effects.

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

def test_retries_on_transient_error():
    """Test that service retries on transient failures."""
    client = Mock()
    # Fail twice, then succeed
    client.request.side_effect = [
        ConnectionError("Failed"),
        ConnectionError("Failed"),
        {"status": "ok"},
    ]

    service = ServiceWithRetry(client, max_retries=3)
    result = service.fetch()

    assert result == {"status": "ok"}
    assert client.request.call_count == 3

def test_gives_up_after_max_retries():
    """Test that service stops retrying after max attempts."""
    client = Mock()
    client.request.side_effect = ConnectionError("Failed")

    service = ServiceWithRetry(client, max_retries=3)

    with pytest.raises(ConnectionError):
        service.fetch()

    assert client.request.call_count == 3

def test_does_not_retry_on_permanent_error():
    """Test that permanent errors are not retried."""
    client = Mock()
    client.request.side_effect = ValueError("Invalid input")

    service = ServiceWithRetry(client, max_retries=3)

    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        service.fetch()

    # Only called once - no retry for ValueError
    assert client.request.call_count == 1
```

### Mocking Time with Freezegun

Use freezegun to control time in tests for predictable time-dependent behavior.

```python
from freezegun import freeze_time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@freeze_time("2026-01-15 10:00:00")
def test_token_expiry():
    """Test token expires at correct time."""
    token = create_token(expires_in_seconds=3600)
    assert token.expires_at == datetime(2026, 1, 15, 11, 0, 0)

@freeze_time("2026-01-15 10:00:00")
def test_is_expired_returns_false_before_expiry():
    """Test token is not expired when within validity period."""
    token = create_token(expires_in_seconds=3600)
    assert not token.is_expired()

@freeze_time("2026-01-15 12:00:00")
def test_is_expired_returns_true_after_expiry():
    """Test token is expired after validity period."""
    token = Token(expires_at=datetime(2026, 1, 15, 11, 30, 0))
    assert token.is_expired()

def test_with_time_travel():
    """Test behavior across time using freeze_time context."""
    with freeze_time("2026-01-01") as frozen_time:
        item = create_item()
        assert item.created_at == datetime(2026, 1, 1)

        # Move forward in time
        frozen_time.move_to("2026-01-15")

### Test Markers

```python
# test_markers.py
import pytest

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_slow_operation():
    """Mark slow tests."""
    import time
    time.sleep(2)


@pytest.mark.integration
def test_database_integration():
    """Mark integration tests."""
    pass


@pytest.mark.skip(reason="Feature not implemented yet")
def test_future_feature():
    """Skip tests temporarily."""
    pass


@pytest.mark.skipif(os.name == "nt", reason="Unix only test")
def test_unix_specific():
    """Conditional skip."""
    pass


@pytest.mark.xfail(reason="Known bug #123")
def test_known_bug():
    """Mark expected failures."""
    assert False


# Run with:
# pytest -m slow          # Run only slow tests
# pytest -m "not slow"    # Skip slow tests
# pytest -m integration   # Run integration tests
```

### Coverage Reporting

```bash
# Install coverage
pip install pytest-cov

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=myapp tests/

# Generate HTML report
pytest --cov=myapp --cov-report=html tests/

# Fail if coverage below threshold
pytest --cov=myapp --cov-fail-under=80 tests/

# Show missing lines
pytest --cov=myapp --cov-report=term-missing tests/
```
